        First: I have completed the React tutorial again for the tic tac toe game. I completed it on the React website and copied the code over.
        Next: I am working to add the elements to my family Feud game.

            Week 2
        </h3>
        First: I wanted to move my about me and Change Log/TODO to the bottom of the page as found on most websites. I completed the tutorial for CSS FLEXBOX Froggy
        However, when I used that, anytime you would hover over a link, it messed up the look and moved the other parts of that section. I instead opted to adjust widths with the text and widths parts instead.
        I need to go over in office hours.
        Second, I examined the actual family feud screen and tried bringing features over. A title that matches the actual title(multicolored lettering).
        Third, I implemented parts of the game via javascript that have to do with score, winners and teams.
        I then tried adding in the JavaScript/React to the react app to try and map out the setup of a board with answers and how 
        a user could click it and then it would flip to show an answer. I would also like the javascript to connect to a text file that contains a question and related answers related
        to the ranking of points for the question. I completed the react tutorial with the square board game, but I was unable to implement that into a family feud gameboard.
        I also am confused about how to simultaneaously implement javascript and TypeScript and when I should use one over another or just use one.

        My project idea for the portfolio of making a Family Feud Game. The idea would be that the site gives several 
category options with several answers from "surveys" and allows the user to play through the game.
I would like the site to make the proper game sounds as well to make it more realistic.

1. I completed the "Basics of the Web" tutorial including HTML, CSS, and some JavaScript.
I then implemented these into two base files for my website, an HTML doc and a CSS Doc.
The website showcares headers, different designs via CSS. The goal is to make it look
similar to the style and look of Family Feud through images and proper colors. 
2. I created some practice TypeScript and JavaScript files but I was not far enough in each 
tutorial to implement it meaningfully into the website. 
3. I also reviewed Bootstrap.
