    <p>
        My project idea for the portfolio of making a Family Feud Game. The idea would be that the site gives several 
category options with several answers from "surveys" and allows the user to play through the game.
I would like the site to make the proper game sounds as well to make it more realistic.

1. I completed the "Basics of the Web" tutorial including HTML, CSS, and some JavaScript.
I then implemented these into two base files for my website, an HTML doc and a CSS Doc.
The website showcares headers, different designs via CSS. The goal is to make it look
similar to the style and look of Family Feud through images and proper colors. 
2. I created some practice TypeScript and JavaScript files but I was not far enough in each 
tutorial to implement it meaningfully into the website. 
3. I also reviewed Bootstrap.
