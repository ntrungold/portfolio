    <h1>Final Thoughts:</h1>
    <p>
        Overall, I feel that I have demonstrated significant understandings of the required languages, styles, and skills. I am a better user of Git and feel
        prepared to work with a group on a project. I now have a better understanding of what I can accomplish each week, too. I have also tried unique
        skills including Modal and adding a popup feature. I watched many tutorials other than those assigned including Professor Bart's. Hopefully this is demonstrated
        in my work and in the logs below.

            Week 4(Final Week)
        </h3>
        First, I got my React application to deploy to github pages. This week I added several features including a "Popup"
        using Modal that shows the Setup of the game. This was a lengthy addition with work that can be viewed in the "Popup" folder in components. I hope this demonstrates a deeper level of 
        react and hooks. I also fixed the issue last week with buttons and got not only the logic of clicking the button to reveal an answer to work, but also the ability to seperate each button
        to reveal only its designated answer(something that I was having trouble with). Next I added some CSS to the site to make it look nicer and cleaner based on what I viewed on User interface design.
        I overall integrated input controls, organized into containers, and tried to make the interface clean and logical. The UI is also consistent.
        I also made sure to add game rules via a link. I ended up for the sake of time and to focus on demonstrating other uses of my coding ability not adding a physical scoreboard. 
        The idea behind this is that I simulated the gameplay with a few groups of friends(gathering requirements!!!) and they found it was easiest to score the round on paper rather than on the computer so they could
        keep score on a per game rather than an overall basis. Second, they mentioned that it was hard to use a buzzer online with two people on one mouse so I decided to keep it off.
        Last, I added sets of answers and I added testing to the app. I hope you all enjoy and find that this week I demonstrated more knowledge and completed assignment requirements. 
        I know the game itself does not simulate every part of family feud, but after discussions with TAs about progress we felt the actual computer science was more important
        than intergrating similar features(another table, another button) more. Thank you!

        <h3>
            Week 3
        </h3>
        First: I have completed the React tutorial again for the tic tac toe game. I completed it on the React website and copied the code over.
        Next: I completed tutorials with javascript and react. I demonstrated react by including a useState hook, practiced state by adding seperated component files
        and finished creating my header and adding buttons. I then started the process of switching to TypeScript
        Next: I created a csv file with 3 questions in it(to be updated with real data for next week) and converted to JSON and added in.
        Next: I created all the features of my website. A table connected to answers, one buttons that create a new game and one that will eventually go to a page with rules and how to play
        Next: I created a button that when clicked shows an answer correlated to the numbered spot.
        I completed professor barts tutorial and the tic tac toe tutorial and several online tutorials feel I have a deep understanding of react and typescript and bootstrap.
        This should be evidenced by my work. 
        NOTE: Reference all relevant work in "new-app". This is what is relevant to my website.
        The work in my-app was good but it utilized react with javascript and not typescript so I had to start over.
        This time I made sure to have smaller commits and I also connected this app to github pages. Unfotunately it is not showing the game on the website(it did for VS code) but I can fix that at office hours 
        as the underlying code works.

        <h3>
            Week 2
        </h3>
        First: I wanted to move my about me and Change Log/TODO to the bottom of the page as found on most websites. I completed the tutorial for CSS FLEXBOX Froggy
        However, when I used that, anytime you would hover over a link, it messed up the look and moved the other parts of that section. I instead opted to adjust widths with the text and widths parts instead.
        I need to go over in office hours.
        Second, I examined the actual family feud screen and tried bringing features over. A title that matches the actual title(multicolored lettering).
        Third, I implemented parts of the game via javascript that have to do with score, winners and teams.
        I then tried adding in the JavaScript/React to the react app to try and map out the setup of a board with answers and how 
        a user could click it and then it would flip to show an answer. I would also like the javascript to connect to a text file that contains a question and related answers related
        to the ranking of points for the question. I completed the react tutorial with the square board game, but I was unable to implement that into a family feud gameboard.
        I also am confused about how to simultaneaously implement javascript and TypeScript and when I should use one over another or just use one.

            Week 1
            </h3>
            My project idea for the portfolio of making a Family Feud Game. The idea would be that the site gives several 
        category options with several answers from "surveys" and allows the user to play through the game.
        I would like the site to make the proper game sounds as well to make it more realistic.

        1. I completed the "Basics of the Web" tutorial including HTML, CSS, and some JavaScript.
        I then implemented these into two base files for my website, an HTML doc and a CSS Doc.
        The website showcares headers, different designs via CSS. The goal is to make it look
        similar to the style and look of Family Feud through images and proper colors. 
        2. I created some practice TypeScript and JavaScript files but I was not far enough in each 
        tutorial to implement it meaningfully into the website. 
        3. I also reviewed Bootstrap.
