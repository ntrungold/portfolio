            Week 2:
            I need to meaningfully implement React, Typescript, Javascript and gain more of an example of use cases. Next week I would like to view more
            websites and implement similar features into my website and model it like P. Bart does in class. I'm having too much trouble organically adding it based on the tutorials.
            I would also like to add more to the website in terms of features and style to make it look like the real game. 
            This week was a learning week. Next week(after office hours) I'd like to do more implementing.
