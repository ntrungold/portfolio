            Week 3:
            I need to fix the answer button and add it to all answers in the table. While I am able to activate it I want it to work better(it took me ALOT of time to figure out how to add that button and make it conditional on a click). I want to add real data with questions and answers.
            I need to polish the look and fix the problems with git not showing the proper react-app content online. Last I need to add a few characteristics of the game including
            Xs for wrong answers and a scoring system to announce a winner. This is all attainable given I have the mainn structure of the site down.

            Week 2:
            I need to meaningfully implement React, Typescript, Javascript and gain more of an example of use cases. Next week I would like to view more
            websites and implement similar features into my website and model it like P. Bart does in class. I'm having too much trouble organically adding it based on the tutorials.
            I would also like to add more to the website in terms of features and style to make it look like the real game. 
            This week was a learning week. Next week(after office hours) I'd like to do more implementing.
